# SD210-ML_project

Machine Learning at Télécom Paris.
The aim of the project was to learn how to use different machine learning methods to perform 3 different tasks: binary classification, multi-class classification and regression. We started by visualizing and cleaning the data (dimension reduction, normalization) to be able to choose the most suitable model for the data set. Once the model was chosen, we were able to evaluate the quality of the model to draw conclusions.
